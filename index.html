            <p>Mike Sevik was born in Boulder Colorado, and soon moved to Denver, where he stayed for a majority of his childhood; however, for the remainder of his childhood, he moved to and lived in Long Island, New York, Salt Lake City, Utah, Istanbul Turkey, Albaquerque, New Mexico, El Paso, Texas--until finally settling in the San Francisco Bay Area at the age of 10.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although Mike has tried settling into adulthood... with work, and all the consistencies (i.e., mediocrities) that come with itâ€¦ he has not lost touch with his childhood, as he is still kicking with wanderlust. He still goes to Turkey regularly, but also to Barcelona Spain. And while he only went to South Africa once, for three weeks, he claims he left his heart there... and longs for the day to go back.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is Mike's first stab at coding... hoepfully, in the near future, as he builds his coding skills, he can get to working remotely while allowing for excursions to South Africa, and beyond!... stay tuned.
